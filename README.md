**WARNING: This package is not ready for production yet. If you would like to help make that happen quicker please consider [contributing](https://github.com/HFulcher/gapipy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)**

`gapipy` provides a clean and simple wrapper around the Google Analytics Reporting API (v4) to allow for custom queries and report generation.

- **Authentication** - Via service accounts or installed applications. (_In Progress_)
- **Single and Batch Report Requests** - Compile requests using metrics, dimensions, segments and multiple date ranges. (_In Progress_)
- **Report Exporting** - Export as standard JSON or in CSV/XLS format. (_Coming Soon_)

This package is built on top of [Google's own API client for Python][apiclient]. This package also stands on the shoulders of previous Google API packages. Notably:

- [alphagov/gapy](https://github.com/alphagov/gapy)
